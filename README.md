# flickr-dl.userscript
A userscript for downloading Flickr photos.

## Usage
Click the **Download** buttons to instantly trigger single image downloads.

#### Enhanced to support batch downloads!
You can now use the **Download All** button on most pages to setup a batch download of all loaded images.

Clicking it will *NOT* immediately start downloads; instead, the direct links get resolved and get added to the page as *hidden data*.

At this point, you need to use a third-party tool such as this [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multithreaded-download-manager/) for Firefox or Internet Download Manager to grab the links from the page and do a batch download.
